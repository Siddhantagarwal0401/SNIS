- **Real-time Feedback**: Instant visual confirmation of detected symptoms

### üíä **Smart Diagnosis Engine**
- **Symptom-based Matching**: Advanced rule-based algorithm matches extracted symptoms against disease database
- **Confidence Scoring**: Percentage-based confidence levels for accurate predictions
- **Multi-disease Detection**: Ranks all possible matches by confidence score
- **Urgency Indicators**: Color-coded urgency levels (Critical, High, Medium)

### üè• **Comprehensive Health Information**

## Rule-Based AI Architecture

### Symptom Extraction Engine

The AI uses a sophisticated rule-based approach with multiple layers:

**Layer 1: Keyword Database**
- 20+ symptom categories with 5-7 keyword variations each
- Examples: "diarrhea" ‚Üí ["diarrhea", "loose stool", "watery stool", "runny stool"]
- Covers medical terms, colloquial language, and common misspellings

**Layer 2: Direct Keyword Matching**
- Normalizes user input (lowercase, trim whitespace)
- Scans text for exact keyword matches
- Prevents duplicate symptom detection

**Layer 3: Context-Aware Phrase Recognition**
- Identifies common symptom descriptions: "I have", "experiencing", "feeling"
- Extracts symptom context from surrounding words
- Handles sentence structure variations

**Layer 4: Confidence Scoring**
- Calculates symptom relevance based on keyword frequency
- Returns normalized 0-1 confidence scores

### Diagnosis Matching Engine

**Step 1: Symptom Extraction**
```
User Input: "I have fever, diarrhea, and vomiting"
AI Output: ["Fever", "Diarrhea", "Vomiting"]
```

**Step 2: Disease Matching**
- Compares extracted symptoms against 5 disease profiles
- Each disease has 4-7 documented symptoms

**Step 3: Confidence Calculation**
```
Confidence = (Matched Symptoms / Total Disease Symptoms) √ó 100
```

**Step 4: Ranking & Display**
- Sorts diseases by confidence score (highest first)
- Returns top match with full details
- Includes urgency mapping for medical guidance

## Disease Database

Currently includes 5 major water-borne diseases:

1. **Cholera** (Bacterial, Critical)
2. **Typhoid** (Bacterial, High)
3. **Giardiasis** (Parasitic, Medium)
4. **Amoebiasis** (Parasitic, High)
5. **Hepatitis A** (Viral, High)

Each disease entry includes:
- Unique ID
- Category and severity level
- Symptoms with individual severity ratings
- Home remedies with instructions and frequency
- Doctor consultation guidelines

## Color Theme

- **Primary Teal**: `#009688` - Main brand color
- **Deep Blue**: `#004D40` - Text and accents
- **Light Aqua**: `#E0F7FA` - Backgrounds
- **Urgency High**: `#E53935` (Red)
- **Urgency Medium**: `#FB8C00` (Orange)
- **Urgency Low**: `#43A047` (Green)

## Customization

### Adding New Diseases

Edit `diseases.json` and add a new disease object following this structure:

```json
{
  "id": "disease_006",
  "name": "Disease Name",
  "category": "bacterial|viral|parasitic",
  "severity": "critical|high|medium|low",
  "transmission": "waterborne",
  "symptoms": [
    {
      "symptom": "Symptom description",
      "severity": "critical|high|medium|low"
    }
  ],
  "homeRemedies": [
    {
      "remedy": "Remedy name",
      "instructions": "How to use it",
      "frequency": "How often"
    }
  ],
  "consultDoctor": {
    "required": true,
    "urgency": "immediate|high|medium",
    "reason": "Explanation"
  }
}
```

### Adding New Symptoms

Edit `COMMON_SYMPTOMS` list in `diagnosis_engine.py`
